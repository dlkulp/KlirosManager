# KlirosManager
Manage your PDF and MusicXML files. Save, sort, and search your music efficiently and quickly with a variety of tags to quickly locate the music you're looking for!

Kliros Manager aims to create a platform to manage sheet music - sorting them into collections, detecting duplicate uploads, autocompleting metadata, and allowing minor edits from the comfort of your browser. The platform will provide a public library of free scores in the public domain but also allow users to keep scores in a private collection. Finally, the platform will provide the ability for directors to assemble private binders of music which can be shared with external users for use during rehearsals or services.
